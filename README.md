# De novo assembly of Streptomyces genomes and identification of secondary metabolites

Actinobacteria are members of the Streptomyces genus and are known for producing diverse secondary metabolites, including antibiotics and antifungal agents. The study of the microbial metabolites has witnessed significant findings for the bioactive compounds. Nevertheless, variations in the activity of these compounds between the strains and their respective extracted metabolites remain an area of investigation. In this study, three strains, B2, B108, and B113, were studied to assess their activity and extracts in vitro and potential reasons for differences were analyzed. Comparative analysis of metabolites revealed the presence of Collinomycins, CDA compounds, and other bioactive metabolites across the strains with different percentages. By integrating biochemical and activity analysis, this study aims to investigate the interplay between bioactive compounds and possible environmental factors such as calcium and the functional ability across the strains and their extracts.

The main steps of this project: 

  1) Introduction of the biological problem (OA)
  2) Introduction to de novo genome assembly (LF)
  3) QC and assemble your genomes
  4) Compare your draft genome to other genomes
  5) Visualization with Bandage, DOT or other tools
  6) Finalisation of an assembly
  7) Validate and annotate the assembly
